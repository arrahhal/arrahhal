I'm **arrahhal**, an **IT student** and an **junior web developer** with hands-on experience React.js, Next.js and Node.js. I'm currently focused on improving my skills in both React and Node.

I'm passionate about Linux and FOSS and try to spread their adoption in my local community. I'm committed to continuously learning and improving my skills.
